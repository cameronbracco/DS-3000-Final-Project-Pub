(Sec. 238) Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended by the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2014, to revise requirements with respect to the flat rental amount established by a public housing agency (PHA) for a PHA dwelling unit at levels no lower than 80% of the applicable fair market rental. Repeals the requirement that the rental value of the unit be determined by the PHA. Authorizes the Secretary, in the alternative, to establish another applicable fair market rental that more accurately reflects local market conditions, based on a market area geographically smaller than the one otherwise used for such purposes. Permits a PHA to apply to the Secretary for exception allowing for a flat rental amount for a property lower than the amount otherwise determined under the Act. Authorizes the Secretary to grant such an exception if: (1) the fair market rental determined pursuant to either the primary or alternative calculation does not reflect the property's actual market value, and (2) the proposed lower flat rental amount is based on a market analysis of the applicable market and complies with the further requirement that rent structures not create a disincentive for continued residency in public housing by families who are attempting to become economically self-sufficient through employment or who have attained a level of self-sufficiency through their own efforts. Repeals the June 1, 2014, deadline for PHA compliance with the requirement to establish a flat rental amount for a PHA dwelling unit at such levels.

Division O: Multiemployer Pension Reform - Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 - Title I: Modifications to Multiemployer Plan Rules - Subtitle A: Amendments to Pension Protection Act of 2006 - (Sec. 101) Amends the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA), the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), and the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to repeal the December 31, 2014, sunset of, and make permanent, the PPA multiemployer funding rules. (Sec. 102) Amends ERISA and the IRC to authorize the sponsor of a multiemployer plan that is not in critical status for a plan year, but that is projected by the plan actuary to be in critical status in any of the succeeding five plan years, to elect to be in critical status effective for the current plan year. Prescribes annual certification and notice requirements. (Sec. 103) Revises requirements for the emergence of a plan from critical status to add a requirement that the plan actuary certify that the plan is not projected to become insolvent for any of the 30 succeeding plan years. Requires an emerged plan to reenter critical status only if it meets either of the current or the new criterion for critical status. (Sec. 104) Declares that a plan shall cease to be in endangered status for a plan year if:  the plan actuary certifies that it is projected to no longer to qualify for such status at the end of the 10th plan year after it entered that status, and the plan was not in critical or endangered status for the immediately preceding plan year.  (Sec. 105) Revises the formula for determining an increase in a plan's funding percentage, which is one of the two goals of a funding improvement plan that must be adopted for multiemployer plans in endangered status. (Sec. 106) Revises rules for operation of a plan in endangered status during the period of adoption of a funding improvement plan. (Sec. 107) Revises requirements for the imposition of a schedule for multiemployer plans in endangered or critical status where, after a collective bargaining agreement expires, the bargaining parties fail to adopt a contribution schedule under a funding improvement plan (endangered status) or a rehabilitation plan (critical status). (Sec. 108) Repeals rules for the reorganization of multiemployer plans, including related minimum contribution requirements, the overburden credit against minimum contribution requirements, and requirements for adjustments in accrued benefits. Treats remaining references to plans in reorganization as plans in critical status. (Sec. 109) Revises requirements for rehabilitation plans that must be adopted for multiemployer plans in critical status. Revises in particular the requirements, when determining an employer's withdrawal liability, for the disregard of:  benefit reductions in determining a plan's unfunded vested benefits, and surcharges in determining the allocation of such unfunded vested benefits.   Requires the disregard of surcharges, as well, in determining the highest contribution rate. Requires disregard also, in determining the allocation of unfunded vested benefits to an employer, and in determining the highest contribution rate, of any increase in the contribution rate (or any other increase in contribution requirements unless due to increased levels of work, employment, or periods for which compensation is provided) that is required or made in order to enable the multiemployer plan to meet the requirements of the funding improvement plan or rehabilitation plan. Declares that, in the case of such disregarded increases in the contribution rate (or other increases in contribution requirements unless due to increased levels of work, employment, or periods for which compensation is provided), these requirements shall cease to apply once a collective bargaining agreement expires which was in effect when the multiemployer plan emerged from endangered or critical status. (Sec. 110) Declares that a qualified preretirement survivor annuity payable to the surviving spouse of a participant under a multiemployer plan which becomes insolvent or is terminated shall not be treated as forfeitable solely because the participant has not died as of the date on which the plan became insolvent or was terminated. (Thus guarantees, in the absence of other disqualifying factors, the payment by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation [PBGC] of a qualified preretirement survivor annuity to a participant of a multiemployer pension plan which becomes insolvent or is terminated.) Makes this prohibition retroactive to multiemployer plan benefit payments payable on or after January 1, 1985, except where the surviving spouse has died before enactment of this Act. (Sec. 111) Expands the sorts of information the administrator of a multiemployer define benefit plan must furnish, upon request, to any plan participant or beneficiary, employee representative, or employer obliged to contribute to the plan. Adds to the list, among other things, copies of the current plan document, the latest summary plan description, the current trust agreement, an employer's participation agreement, audited plan financial statements, and the latest funding improvement or rehabilitation plan and related contribution schedules for any plan in critical or endangered status. Authorizes any employee representative, or any employer obliged to contribute to a plan, to bring a civil action to: (1) enjoin any act or practice which violates these disclosure requirements, or (2) obtain appropriate equitable relief to redress a violation or enforce the requirements. Subtitle B: Multiemployer Plan Mergers and Partitions - (Sec. 121) Authorizes the PBGC, upon sponsor request, to take appropriate action to promote and facilitate the merger of two or more multiemployer plans if it determines that the transaction is in the interests of the participants and beneficiaries of at least one of the plans and is not reasonably expected to be adverse to the overall interests of the participants and beneficiaries of any of the plans. Permits such facilitation to include training, technical assistance, mediation, communication with stakeholders, and support with related requests to other government agencies.  Authorizes the PBGC to enable one or more of the plans involved in a merger to avoid or postpone insolvency by providing financial assistance to a merged plan, but only if:  one or more of the multiemployer plans participating in the merger is in critical and declining status; the PBGC reasonably expects that the financial assistance will reduce its expected long-term loss with respect to the plans involved, and is necessary for the merged plan to become or remain solvent; and  the financial assistance is paid exclusively from the fund for basic benefits guaranteed for multiemployer plans.  (Sec. 122) Revises requirements for the partition of a plan. Makes a multiemployer plan eligible for partition only if:  the plan is in critical and declining status; the PBGC determines, after consultation with the selected Participant and Plan Sponsor Advocate, that the plan sponsor has taken (or is taking concurrently with an application for partition) all reasonable measures to avoid insolvency, including certain maximum benefit suspensions, if applicable; the PBGC reasonably expects that a partition will reduce it's expected long-term loss with respect to the plan, and is necessary for the plan to remain solvent; the PBGC certifies to Congress that its ability to meet existing financial assistance obligations to other plans (including any liabilities associated with multiemployer plans that are insolvent or that are projected to become insolvent within 10 years) will not be impaired by the partition; and the cost to the PBGC arising from the partition is paid exclusively from the fund for basic benefits guaranteed for multiemployer plans.  Requires a partition order to provide for a transfer to a successor plan of the minimum amount of the partitioned plan's liabilities necessary for the plan to remain solvent. Prescribes requirements for:  the withdrawal liability of any employer that withdraws from the partitioned plan within 10 years after the partition order, and  payment of the monthly benefit to each participant or beneficiary of the partitioned plan whose benefit was transferred to the successor plan.  Requires any successor plan that provides a benefit improvement effective after the partition's effective date to pay the PBGC a specified amount related to the increase in benefit payments for each year during the 10-year period following partition. Requires the partitioned plan to pay the premiums imposed by the PBGC with respect to participants whose benefits were transferred to the successor plan for each year during that 10-year period. Subtitle C: Strengthening the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation - (Sec. 131) Increases the annual premium rate payable to the PBGC by a multiemployer plan for basic benefits guaranteed to $26 for each individual participant in the plan during each plan year beginning after December 31, 2014. Prescribes a formula for this rate for each plan year beginning in a calendar year after 2015. Requires that specified amounts of premiums received with respect to the fund used for basic multiemployer plan guaranteed benefits be placed in a noninterest-bearing account within the fund. Requires that any PBGC financial assistance to prevent a plan from becoming insolvent be withdrawn proportionately from the noninterest-bearing and other accounts within the fund. Title II: Remediation Measures for Deeply Troubled Plans - (Sec. 201) Revises conditions, limitations, distribution and notice requirements, and the approval process for benefit suspensions under multiemployer plans in critical and declining status. Allows a plan sponsor, by plan amendment, to suspend benefits temporarily or permanently, in accordance with certain requirements, if a plan is in declining as well as critical status, if it is projected to become insolvent during the current plan year or any of the 14 succeeding plan years (19 succeeding plan years if the plan has a ratio of inactive participants to active participants that exceeds 2 to 1, or if the funded percentage of the plan is less than 80%). Requires any suspension of benefits to remain in effect until the earlier of when the plan sponsor provides benefit improvements or the suspension expires by its own terms. Declares that the plan shall not be liable for any benefit payments not made as a result of a suspension of benefits. Requires the sponsor of a plan with 10,000 or more participants, not later than 60 days before applying to suspend benefits, to select a plan participant in pay status to act as a retiree representative to advocate for the interests of the retired and deferred vested participants and plan beneficiaries throughout the suspension approval process. Prescribes as conditions for suspending benefits that:  the plan actuary certifies that the plan is projected to avoid insolvency, assuming the suspensions of benefits continue until they expire by their own terms or, if no such expiration date is set, indefinitely; and the plan sponsor determines in writing that the plan is still projected to become insolvent unless benefits are suspended, although all reasonable measures to avoid insolvency have been taken (and continue to be taken during the period of the benefit suspension).  Specifies limitations on any suspension of benefits, including that:  the monthly benefit of any participant or beneficiary may not be reduced below 110% of the monthly benefit guaranteed by the PBGC on the date of the suspension; not more of the benefits of a participant or beneficiary age 75 years as of the suspension date may be suspended than a certain applicable percentage of the maximum suspendable benefits that would otherwise be suspended, computed according to a specified formula; no benefits based on disability may be suspended; any suspensions of benefits, in the aggregate, shall be reasonably estimated to achieve, but not materially exceed, the level necessary to avoid insolvency; any benefit suspensions shall be equitably distributed across the participant and beneficiary population, taking specified factors into account; and  the benefits suspended shall be applied according to three specified priorities.  Allows a plan sponsor, in its sole discretion, to provide benefit improvements while any suspension of benefits remains in effect. Prohibits the sponsor, however, from increasing plan liabilities by reason of any benefit improvement for any participant or beneficiary not in pay status by the first day of the plan year for which the benefit improvement takes effect, unless certain conditions are met, including an equitable distribution of such improvements. Prescribes requirements for: (1) notice to participants and beneficiaries, (2) the process for approval of a suspension application by the Secretary of the Treasury in consultation with the PBGC and the Secretary of Labor, and (3) a participant ratification voting process. Permits a suspension of benefits to be implemented, notwithstanding rejection of suspension by a participant ratification vote, if the plan is systemically important (i.e., the present value of its PBGC-projected financial assistance payments exceeds $1 billion if suspensions are not implemented). Subjects to judicial review any plan sponsor action to challenge denial of an application for suspension of benefits. Division P: Other Retirement-Related Modifications - (Sec. 1) Amends ERISA with respect to the treatment as a substantial employer subject to specified liability of any employer that ceases operations at a facility in any location with the result that more than 20% percent of the total number of the employees participating under the employer's single-employer pension plan are separated from employment. (The substantial employer liability referred to as specified under current law is the liability of a substantial employer for withdrawal from, or termination of, single-employer plans under multiple controlled groups.) Revises the meaning of a substantial cessation of operations. Eliminates the requirement that more than 20% of the total number of the employer's employees who participate under its single-employer plan be separated from employment. Exempts from the general rule any single employer plan if, for the plan year preceding the plan year in which the substantial cessation of operations occurred: (1) there were fewer than 100 participants with accrued benefits under the plan as of its valuation date, or (2) the ratio of the market value of the assets of the plan to the plan's funding target for the plan year was 90% or greater. Redefines ""substantial cessation of operations"" as a permanent cessation of operations at a facility which results in a workforce reduction of a number of eligible employees at the facility equivalent to more than 15% of the number of all the employer's eligible employees, determined immediately before the earlier of: (1) the date of the employer's decision to implement the cessation; or (2) the earliest date on which any such eligible employee was separated from employment in the case of a workforce reduction including one or more eligible employees whose separation, during the three years before the cessation, is nonetheless related to permanent cessation of operations at the facility. Precludes from taking into account in computing a workforce reduction any separated employee replaced, within a reasonable period of time, at the same or another facility located in the United States, by a U.S. citizen or resident. Prescribes criteria for disregarding in the computation of a workforce reduction either an eligible employee separated from employment with the transferor employer at a facility or an eligible employee who continues to be employed at the facility by the transferee employer. Prescribes requirements for treatment of eligible separated employees when a portion of operations, otherwise substantially ceased, are subsequently conducted by another (transferee) employer by reason of a sale or other disposition of the assets or stock of a contributing sponsor (or any member of the same controlled group as the sponsor) of the plan. Permits an employer to satisfy its liability with respect to a plan by reason of the treatment accorded under this Act in the event of a substantial cessation of operations at a facility by making contributions to the plan, in addition to any minimum required contribution, and in amount determined according to a specified formula, for each plan year in the seven-plan-year period beginning when the cessation occurred.  Waives an employer's obligation to make such additional contributions, however, with respect to: (1) the first plan year (after the cessation occurs) for which the ratio of the market value of the plan assets to the plan's funding target for the plan year is 90% or greater, or (2) any plan year following such a year. Makes such a waiver permanent if the Secretary of the Treasury issues the funding waiver for a plan year within the seven-plan-year period beginning when the cessation occurred. Prescribes requirements for enforcement of any additional plan contributions elected.  Declares that, for purposes of this Act, an employer shall not be treated as ceasing operations at a qualified lodging facility (hotel, motel, or any other establishment more than half of whose dwelling units are used on a transient basis) if those operations are continued by an eligible independent contractor pursuant to an agreement with the employer. (Sec. 2) Formulates a special rule for determining normal retirement age for certain existing defined benefit plans. Exempts from the established normal retirement age requirement any defined benefit plan whose terms, on or before December 8, 2014, provided for a normal retirement age which is the earlier of:  an age otherwise permitted by the established normal retirement age requirement, or the age at which a participant completes the number of years (at least 30 years) of benefit accrual service specified by the plan.  States that a plan shall not fail to be treated as an applicable plan solely because this alternative normal retirement age only applied to certain participants or only applied to employees of certain employers in the case of a multiemployer plan. Allows such a plan to expand the application of its alternative normal retirement age to additional participants or to employees of additional employers maintaining the plan, as long as they: (1) became participants on or before January 1, 2017; or (2) were employees before this date of any employer maintaining the plan, and who become plan participants after January 1, 2017. (Sec. 3) Amends both ERISA and the IRC to apply the rules for cooperative and small employer charity pension plans to a defined benefit employee pension plan (other than a multiemployer plan) maintained, as of June 25, 2010, by a tax-exempt charitable organization:  with employees in at least 40 states, and  whose primary exempt purpose is to provide services with respect to children.  Division Q: Budgetary Effects - (Sec. 1) Exempts the budgetary effects of division 0 (Multiemployer Pension Reform) and division P (Other Retirement- Related Modifications) from provisions of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 and the FY2008 Senate Budget Resolution requiring offsets for legislation increasing the budget deficit. Provides that the budget effects of the two divisions shall not be estimated for the purposes of enforcing discretionary spending limits or specified provisions of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010.

Instructs the Secretary to consult with the Administrator of the Energy Information Administration on the projected energy demands of the United States for the next 30 years and on how energy derived from federal onshore lands can put the United States on a trajectory that meets such demand during the next 4 years, with a goal for increasing energy independence and production. Requires the Secretary to determine a domestic strategic production objective for the development of energy resources from such lands. Expresses the sense of Congress that federally recognized Indian tribes may elect to set their own production objectives as part of the Strategy. Grants the relevant Secretary all necessary authority to make determinations regarding which additional federal lands available for leasing at the time the lease sale occurs will be available to meet the production objectives established by the strategies. Directs the Secretary to take all actions necessary to achieve such objectives unless the President determines that it is not in U.S. national security and economic interests to increase federal domestic energy production and to further decrease dependence upon foreign energy sources. Requires the Secretary, within 12 months of enactment of this Act, to complete a programmatic environmental impact statement in accordance with certain requirements under NEPA. Deems such statement sufficient to be in compliance with NEPA requirements for all necessary resource management and land use plans associated with implementation of the Strategy. Requires the Secretary to submit:(1) each proposed strategy to the President and to Congress prior to publication, including comments received from affected states, local governments and federally recognized tribes; and (2) the first strategy to Congress within 18 months of enactment. Title IV: Onshore Oil and Gas Leasing Certainty - Providing Leasing Certainty for American Energy Act of 2012 - (Sec. 402) Directs the Secretary, in conducting lease sales under the Mineral Leasing Act, to offer for sale at least 25% of the annual nominated acreage not previously made available for lease. Shields such acreage from protest and the test of extraordinary circumstances. Makes it eligible for certain categorical exclusions under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 in connection with review under NEPA. (A categorical exclusion [CE or CX] is a category of actions which do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment and for which, as a consequence, neither an environmental assessment [EA] nor an environmental impact statement [EIS] is required. If a proposed action is included in the description provided for a listed CE established by an agency, the agency must check to make sure that no extraordinary circumstances exist that may cause the proposed action to have a significant effect in a particular situation. Extraordinary circumstances typically include such matters as effects to endangered species, protected cultural sites, and wetlands. If the proposed action is not included in the description in the agency's CE, or there are extraordinary circumstances, the agency must prepare an EA or an EIS, or develop a new proposal that may qualify for application of a CE.) Directs the Secretary to consider leasing only federal lands that are available for leasing at the time the lease sale occurs. (Sec. 403) Amends the Mineral Leasing Act to prohibit the Secretary from: (1) withdrawing any covered energy project issued under that Act without finding a violation by the lessee of lease terms; (2) delaying indefinitely issuance of project approvals, drilling and seismic permits, and rights of way for activities under a lease; and (3) cancelling or withdrawing any lease parcel after a competitive lease sale has occurred and a winning bidder has made the last payment for the parcel. Instructs the Secretary to: (1) make nominated areas available for lease within 18 months after an area is designated as open under a current land use plan, (2) issue all leases sold no later than 60 days after the last payment is made, and (3) adjudicate any lease protests filed following a lease sale. Prohibits additional lease stipulations after the parcel is sold without consultation and agreement of the lessee, unless the Secretary deems such stipulations emergency actions to conserve national resources. (Sec. 404) Requires federal land managers to follow existing resource management plans and continue to actively lease in areas designated as open when resource management plans are being amended or revised until such time as a new record of decision is signed. (Sec. 405) Declares without force or effect Bureau of Land Management Instruction Memorandum 2010-117. Title V: Streamlined Energy Permitting - Streamlining Permitting of American Energy Act of 2012 - Subtitle A: Application for Permits to Drill Process Reform - (Sec. 511) Amends the Mineral Leasing Act to revise requirements for the issuance of permits to drill in energy projects on federal lands. Authorizes the Secretary to extend the initial 30-day permit application review period for up to 2 periods of 15 days each, if the Secretary has given written notice of the delay to the applicant. Deems a permit application approved if the Secretary has made no decision on it 60 days after its receipt. Prescribes a notice requirement for denial of an application. Directs the Secretary to collect a single $6,500 permit processing fee per application from each applicant at the time the decision is made whether or not to issue a permit. Requires that 50% of fees collected as annual wind energy and solar energy right-of-way authorization fees be retained by the Secretary for use by: (1) the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to process permits, right-of-way applications, and other activities necessary for renewable energy development, and (2) either the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service or other federal agencies involved in wind and solar permitting reviews in order to facilitate the processing of wind energy and solar energy permit applications on BLM lands.

Subtitle C: Permit Streamlining - (Sec. 531) Requires the Secretary to: (1) establish a Federal Permit Streamlining Project in every BLM Field office with responsibility for permitting energy projects on federal land, and (2) enter into a related memorandum of understanding with the Secretary of Agriculture, the EPA Administrator, and the Chief of the Army Corps of Engineers. Authorizes the Secretary to request that the governor of any state with energy projects on federal lands be a signatory to the memorandum of understanding. Requires federal signatories to such memorandum to assign staff with special expertise to such field offices. (Sec. 532) States that, with respect to review under NEPA, the Secretary shall not require a finding of extraordinary circumstances related to a categorical exclusion in administering the Energy Policy Act of 2005. (Sec. 533) Expresses the intent of Congress that: (1) this title will support a growing U.S. domestic energy sector that helps to reinvigorate American manufacturing, transportation, and service sectors by employing U.S. workers to assist in the development of energy from domestic sources; and (2) Congress will monitor deployment of personnel and material onshore to encourage development of American technology and manufacturing and to establish industrial facilities to support expanded access to American energy resources. Directs the Secretary to encourage, when practicable, the use of U.S. workers, including equipment manufactured in the United States, in all construction related to mineral resource development under this Act. Subtitle D: Judicial Review - (Sec. 542) States that venue for any covered civil action shall lie in the district court where the project or leases exist or are proposed. Prescribes procedures for judicial review regarding the leasing of federal lands for the exploration, development, production, processing, or transmission of oil, natural gas, wind, or any other energy source of energy. Title VI: Expeditious Program of Oil and Gas Leasing in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska - National Petroleum Reserve Alaska Access Act - (Sec. 602) Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the National Petroleum Reserve (NPR) in Alaska remains explicitly designated to provide oil and natural gas resources to the United States, and (2) it is national policy to actively advance oil and gas development within the NPR. (Sec. 603) Amends the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act of 1976 to require that the mandatory program of competitive leasing of oil and gas in the NPR include at least one lease sale annually in those NPR areas most likely to produce commercial quantities of oil and natural gas each year during 2011-2021. (Sec. 604) Directs the Secretary to ensure, according to a specified timeline, permits for all surface development activities (including pipelines and roads construction) in order to: (1) develop and bring into production areas within the NPR that are subject to oil and gas leases; and (2) transport oil and gas from and through the NPR to existing transportation or processing infrastructure on the North Slope of Alaska. (Sec. 605) Directs the Secretary to: (1) issue regulations establishing clear requirements to ensure that the Department of the Interior is supporting development of oil and gas leases in the NPR, and (2) approve, within 180 days after enactment of this Act, and after public comment and consultation with the state of Alaska, right-of-way corridors for the construction of two separate additional bridges and pipeline rights-of-way to facilitate oil and gas development in the NPR. (Sec. 606) Requires the Secretary to assess all technically recoverable fossil fuel resources within the NPR, including conventional and unconventional oil and natural gas. Requires such resource assessment to be implemented by the U.S. Geological Survey, which is authorized to use resources and funds provided by the State of Alaska. (Sec. 607) Declares without force or effect the EPA designation of the Colville River Delta as an Aquatic Resource of National Importance. Title VII: Internet-Based Onshore Oil and Gas Lease Sales - BLM Live Internet Auctions Act - (Sec. 702) Amends the Mineral Leasing Act to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct onshore oil and gas lease sales through Internet-based bidding methods. Requires each individual Internet-based lease sale to be concluded within seven days. Directs the Secretary to analyze and report on the first 10 such lease sales, including estimates of: (1) increases or decreases in such lease sales compared to sales conducted by oral bidding; and (2) the total cost or savings to the Department of the Interior as a result of such sales, compared to sales conducted by oral bidding. Requires the report to evaluate the demonstrated or expected effectiveness of different structures for lease sales which may provide an opportunity to better maximize bidder participation, ensure the highest return to the federal taxpayers, minimize opportunities for fraud or collusion, and ensure the security and integrity of the leasing process. Title VIII: Service Over the Counter, Self-Contained, Medium Temperature Commercial Refrigerators - (Sec. 801) Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to define and establish energy conservation standards for service over the counter, self-contained, medium (SOC-SC-M) temperature commercial refrigerators. Requires such a refrigerator manufactured 6 months after enactment of the Better Use of Refrigerator Regulations Act to have a specified total daily energy consumption (in kilowatt hours per day). Title IX: Miscellaneous Provisions - (Sec. 901) Prohibits the Secretary of the Interior from transferring to the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement any responsibility or authority to perform any function performed immediately before the enactment of this Act under the Department of the Interior Solid Minerals Program, including management of mineral development on federal lands and acquired lands under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, and any function performed under the Mining Law Program. (Sec. 902) Amends the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 to: (1) contract from FY2016-FY2055 to FY2016-FY2022 the time period during which the annual maximum amount of distributed qualified OCS shelf revenues shall be $500 million, and (2) increase to $750 million the annual maximum amount of distributed qualified OCS revenues for FY2023-FY2055. (Sec. 903) Directs the Secretary to: (1) revise the proposed OCS oil and gas leasing program for 2012-2017 to include Lease Sale 220 off the coast of Virginia, (2) include the OCS off the coast of Virginia in the leasing program for each 5-year period after the 2012-2017 period, and (3) implement Lease Sale 220 within one year after enactment of this Act. Instructs the Secretary and the Secretary of Defense (DOD) to work jointly in implementing these changes to ensure: (1) preserving the ability of the U.S. Armed Forces to maintain an optimum state of readiness through their continued use of the OCS; and (2) allowing effective exploration, development, and production of the national oil, gas, and renewable energy resources. Prohibits any exploration, development, or production of oil or natural gas off the coast of Virginia that would conflict with any military operation. Declares that the United States reserves the right to designate by and through the Secretary of Defense, with the President's approval, national defense areas on the OCS. Title X: Advancing Offshore Wind Production - Advancing Offshore Wind Production Act - (Sec. 1002) Exempts projects determined by the Secretary to be an offshore meteorological site testing and monitoring project from environmental impact statement requirements under NEPA. Defines an ""offshore meteorological site testing and monitoring project"" as a project that is administered by the Department of the Interior and carried out on or in the waters of the OCS to test or monitor weather (including wind, tidal, current, and solar energy) using towers, buoys, or other temporary ocean infrastructure and that: (1) causes less than one acre of surface or seafloor disruption at the location of each meteorological tower or other device and no more than five acres of surface or seafloor disruption within the proposed area affected by the project (including hazards to navigation), (2) is decommissioned within five years of its commencement, and (3) provides meteorological information to the Secretary.

Declares that: (1) coordinated operations between CVP and SWP, as consented to and requested by the state of California and the federal government, require assertion of federal supremacy to protect existing water rights throughout the system, a circumstance that is unique to California; and (2) this title should not serve as precedent for similar operations in any other state. Title VI: Reducing Regulatory Burdens - Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of 2012 - Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the Clean Water Act) to prohibit the EPA Administrator or a state from requiring a permit for a discharge from a point source into navigable waters of a pesticide authorized for sale, distribution, or use under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) or the residue resulting from application of such pesticide. Exempts from such prohibition: (1) a discharge resulting from the application of a pesticide in violation of a provision of FIFRA that is relevant to protecting water quality if the discharge would not have occurred but for the violation or if the quantity of pesticide or pesticide residue in the discharge is greater than would have occurred without the violation; (2) stormwater discharges subject to regulation under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES); and (3) discharges, subject to NPDES regulation, of manufacturing or industrial effluent, treatment works effluent, and discharges incidental to the normal operation of a vessel, including a discharge resulting from ballasting operations or vessel biofouling prevention. Amends FIFRA to prohibit the Administrator or a state from requiring a permit under the Clean Water Act except under such circumstances. Title VII: Farm Dust Regulation Prevention - Farm Dust Regulation Prevention Act of 2012 - Amends the Clean Air Act (CAA) to prohibit the Administrator from proposing, finalizing, implementing, or enforcing any regulation revising the national primary ambient air quality standard or the national secondary ambient air quality standard applicable to particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter greater than 2.5 micrometers for one year. Exempts nuisance dust from the CAA and excludes nuisance dust from CAA references to particulate matter, except with respect to geographic areas where such dust is not regulated under state, tribal, or local law to the extent the Administrator finds that: (1) nuisance dust causes substantial adverse public health and welfare effects at ambient concentrations, and (2) the benefits of applying CAA standards and other requirements to such dust outweigh the costs. Defines ""nuisance dust"" as particulate matter that: (1) is generated primarily from natural sources, unpaved roads, agricultural activities, earth moving, or other activities typically conducted in rural areas; and (2) consists primarily of soil, other natural or biological materials, or some combination of such materials.

Requires a contractor, to be authorized to perform such retrofit work, to affirm in each Home Star rebate application submitted to a rebate aggregator that it meets specified requirements, including: (1) agreeing to pass through to the owner of a home, through a discount, the full economic value of all rebates received with respect to the home; and (2) certifying that no employee has been convicted of, or pleaded guilty to, a crime of child molestation, rape, or any other form of sexual assault. Requires the Secretary to: (1) provide administrative and technical support to rebate aggregators and states; and (2) transmit to Congress a state-by-state analysis and review of the distribution of Home Star retrofit rebates. Prohibits the Secretary from utilizing authority provided under this Act to: (1) develop, adopt, or implement a public labeling system that rates and compares the energy performance of one home with another; or (2) require the public disclosure of an energy performance evaluation or rating developed for any specific home. Authorizes the Secretary to adjust the rebate amounts provided for under this Act to optimize the overall energy efficiency resulting from the Silver Star Home Energy Retrofit Program (Silver Star Program) and the Gold Star Home Energy Retrofit Program (Gold Star Program) established by this Act. Sets forth provisions concerning state and Indian tribe participation in the Home Star Retrofit Rebate Program. Prohibits rebates from being provided under the Silver Star Program and the Gold Star Program with respect to the same home unless the energy savings measures installed pursuant to the Silver Star Program are excluded from the calculations performed for purposes of the Gold Star Program and the total amount of rebates paid for the home does not exceed the maximum rebate available pursuant to the Gold Star Home Energy Retrofit Program. Encourages states that receive grants under this Act to form partnerships with utilities, energy service companies, and other entities to: (1) assist in marketing the Home Star Retrofit Rebate Program; (2) facilitate consumer financing; (3) assist in implementing the Silver Star Program and the Gold Star Program; and (4) assist in implementing quality assurance programs. Requires states, in carrying out rebate programs, to give priority to comprehensive retrofit programs in existence on this Act's enactment. Requires the Secretary to establish and publicize a telephone hotline for contractors and homeowners to call to obtain information about the programs under this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to establish an online chat function through the website established for the Home Star Retrofit Rebate Program. Requires the Secretary to ensure that a home in an area declared by the President under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act as an area affected by a major disaster is not denied assistance under the Home Star Retrofit Rebate Program solely because there is no equipment or system to replace due to the disaster. Provides that homeowners with a gross annual household income of more than $250,000 shall not be eligible for a rebate. (Sec. 2) Requires the Secretary to: (1) develop a network of rebate aggregators that can facilitate the delivery of rebates to reimburse homeowners for work provided by participating contractors and vendors for energy efficiency retrofit work; (2) identify a sufficient number of rebate aggregators in each state to ensure that rebate applications can be accepted from all qualified contractors; (3) ensure that rebate aggregation services are available to all homeowners at the lowest reasonable cost; and (4) develop guidelines for states to allow utilities participating as rebate aggregators to count the energy savings from their participation toward state-level energy saving targets. Sets forth eligibility criteria for, and responsibilities of, rebate aggregators.
